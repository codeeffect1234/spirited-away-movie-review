<h1>Review of Spirited Away</h1>
<div id="nav">
	
<h3 style = "font-family:Bradley Hand ITC"><font color="black"><h3>Amazing!</h3> This is the best animated film I have ever seen. The film is so imaginative and inspired.<br> Spirited Away is stuffed to the brim with all kinds of themes such as growing up, rebirth, present and past, identity, greed, love,<br> and of course, the environment.Adventure is one of the main theme shown in the movie.</h3></font>

<h3 style = "font-family:Bradley Hand ITC"><font color="black"><p><u>Talking about characters:</u><br>
Whole movie focuses on these characters only.<br>
<i>Chihiro</i> is the main protagonist and heroine of Spirited Away. Her character is very well shown.
<i>Haku</i> is the main hero of Spirited Away. He showed as a dragon.
<i>Yubaba</i> is the evil witch and owner of the bathhouse.This character is very well designed.
<i>Rin</i> is a common female worker of the bathhouse. Firstly her character was rude but later she had shown nice.
<i>No-face</i> is a monster of the spirit world who cannot remember who he is and where he lives.</h3></font>

<h3 style = "font-family:Bradley Hand ITC"><font color="black"><p><u>Visual representation :</u>
There are alot of visual representations in Spirited Away, as there are so many ways to enhance the description of a thing using visual affects.. There is a scene, when Chihiro and her family reach the entrance of the amusement park, the tunnel ahead is very dark, which signifies the mysterious and when they move ahead lights comes giving a feeling of hope.</h3></font>
</p>
</div>
<div class="article column2">
<h3 style = "font-family:Bradley Hand ITC"><font color="black"><p><u>Music:</u>
There are alot of different types of music, which occurs in Spirited Away, to normally reflect what is going on at the time
I like the way how the scene happening is more dramatic, the music slows down and becomes louder and more grand. In one of the scene, Chihero falls from the step and whenever she touches the step, keyboard sound plays in the background is one the best music scene in the movie.</h3></font>
</p>
</div>
<div class="article column3">
<h3 style = "font-family:Bradley Hand ITC"><font color="black"><p><u>Camera:</u>

As Spirited Away is a film, it is made up of camera angles, but different camera angles can be used to enhance certain scenes in it.</h3></font>
